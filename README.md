A weekend-long burglary of the basic features of Dwarf Fortress.

Tux and his friends were surprised when a huge ice chunk drifted
into the nearby sea.  The chunk was so huge that some penguins packed
their bags and decided to stake out a piece of the chunk to live on.
The elders call this chunk "Arctia", and you are leading a colony
of penguin settlers on this new territory.
