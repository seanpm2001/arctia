## What is Arctia?
Arctia is a small game in the same genre as Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld.
I wrote Arctia for practice, for fun, and as a tribute to the game genre.

Tux and his friends were surprised when a huge ice chunk drifted
into the nearby sea.  The chunk was so huge that some penguins packed
their bags and decided to stake out a piece of the chunk to live on.
The elders call this chunk "Arctia", and you are leading a colony
of penguin settlers on this new territory.

## Controls
You can switch tools by clicking the menu buttons on the left.

To designate areas using tools, click on tiles within the world.

To scroll across the map, right-click and drag.

## Dependencies
You need Pygame and PyTMX in order to run the game.

These are the versions I test it with:

* Pygame 1.9.3
* PyTMX 3.21.3

Both of them can be installed thru Pip like so:

    pip install --user pygame==1.9.3
    pip install --user pytmx==3.21.3

## Running
Just run:

    python arctia.py
