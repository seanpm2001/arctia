Penguin Smartness Project
-------------------------

Penguins should go to their stockpiles first for food.

Furthermore, teams should keep a map of distances from stockpiles
to every point.  With this information, penguins can always
visit the closest stockpile for goods.

* Masonry Workshops
* Doors (which Penguins can pass but other animals cannot)
