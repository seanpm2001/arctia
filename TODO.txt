1) HAULED COVERING ORIGINAL ITEMS

  When penguins drop hauled goods, the dropped goods cover up any
  item that was previously in that spot.

  Every square should only allow one item.

  In other words, the stage should have a mxn matrix of what item is
  on a given square.  Penguins should remove items which are in a slot
  for a stockpile.  (Maybe just trade it---the penguin recieves a
  DumpJob and swaps the items?)

2) MINE WEIRD HILIGHT LEFTOVER

  When the penguins were mining, a highlight stayed on a tile that
  was already dug.
